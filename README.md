In these days, most of applications are on the web.  
With various frameworks, how do you pick for your need?  


## Framework selection and transition

In the simple data collection/presentation, 
we want to the application ready in a short time.  
In a mission critical transaction, we may consider the performance.  

What if you want to have a quick prototype to present to manager team, 
then deep dive into the right solution after planned?  
In here, I am going to have solution of how to do.  

In here, I am going to use bookstore model as example in some different kinds of projects.
